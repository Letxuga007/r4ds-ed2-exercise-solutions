# About this book

This unofficial book is inspired by the [R for Data Science Exercise Solutions](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/) and is an updated version in line with the second edition release of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) also referred to in the short form as R4DS.

Like the two books mentioned, this is divided into the same sections with the same numbering for exercises. 
Sections without exercises will appear but with the callout block:


::: {.callout-note}
There are no exercises in this section.

To attempt to make this book closely referenced to the original there will be hyperlinks for the chapter numbers and these may break if the book changes.
There are no links or corresponding scripts to the the part sections of the R4DS book.

## GitHub/Quarto scripts

The book is built using the code names that follow the R4DS names which are listed in the corresponding [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/main/_quarto.yml).

This book follows the [NHS-R Way](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/NHSR-way/community-handbook.html) code book style with each sentence having a new line following _The Turing Way_.
