Sections without exercises will appear but with the callout block:\nTo attempt to make this book closely referenced to the original there will be hyperlinks for the chapter numbers and these may break if the book changes. There are no links or corresponding scripts to the the part sections of the R4DS book."

Read the help for ?penguins to find out.\nMake a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis. Describe the relationship between these two variables.\nWhat happens if you make a scatterplot of species vs. bill_depth_mm? What might be a better choice of geom?\nWhy does the following give an error and how would you fix it?\n\n\nggplot(data = penguins) + \ngeom_point()\n\n\nWhat does the na.rm argument do in geom_point()? What is the default value of the argument? Create a scatterplot where you successfully use this argument set to TRUE.\nAdd the following caption to the plot you made in the previous exercise: “Data come from the palmerpenguins package.” Hint: Take a look at the documentation for labs().\nRecreate the following visualization. What aesthetic should bill_depth_mm be mapped to? And should it be mapped at the global level or at the geom level?\n\n2.4.3\n\nMake a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?\nHow are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?\n\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"red\")\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"red\")\n\n\nWhat does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?\nMake a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?"
